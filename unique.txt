Changes:
- Coordinate system changed to float values
- Enemies now follow character
	- Enemies constantly spawn
- Character can also move up and down
	- Smoothed out movement
	- WASD instead of arrow keys
- Pokemon sprites as placeholders

New:
- Left click to shoot
- 3 lives
- Randomly spawning ammo


- There is a bug that randomly occurs when shooting that will crash the game. I should have fixed it but
the cause is due to the use of erase on vectors.
